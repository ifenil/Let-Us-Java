# Rules of contribution

## Code contribution
- Please make sure to add your code in the directory that makes sense, if there is no directory present please make one.
- Please make sure to add a code that is not simply a print statement saying something random and an actual contribution
- Add as many codes you want, every contribution welcome

## ReadMe contribution
- Please make sure that the formatting is all good and is not messy
- No PRs just for a few typos, however feel free to make a PR listing the contributors' name who have contributed to the repository but their username is not on the ReadMe
